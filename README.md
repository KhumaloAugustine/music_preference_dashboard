# 🎶 Music Preference Predictor Dashboard

This project presents an interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit that predicts a user's music genre preference based on their age and gender. It demonstrates a fundamental machine learning classification task using Python's `scikit-learn` library.

## ✨ Features

-   **Interactive Prediction:** Input your age and gender to get an instant music genre prediction.
-   **Data Overview:** See a sample of the dataset used for training.
-   **Data Insights:** Visualize distributions of genres, ages, and genre preferences by gender.
-   **Model Performance:** View the accuracy of the trained Machine Learning model.
-   **Clear Explanations:** Understand the underlying machine learning concepts.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the Decision Tree Classifier model.
* **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive web application/dashboard.
* **matplotlib & seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **joblib:** For saving and loading the trained machine learning model.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The core of this project is a **Decision Tree Classifier**. It learns patterns from a dataset containing `age`, `gender` (encoded as 0 or 1), and their corresponding `music genre` preferences. Once trained, the model can then predict a genre for new, unseen combinations of age and gender.

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to get the dashboard running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/music_preference_dashboard.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/music_preference_dashboard.git)
    cd music_preference_dashboard
    ```
    (Replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Train the Machine Learning Model:**
    This step creates the `trained_model.pkl` and `genres.pkl` files needed by the app.
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
    You should see output confirming the model training and saving.

6.  **Run the Streamlit Dashboard:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your default web browser should automatically open a new tab with the dashboard (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).
